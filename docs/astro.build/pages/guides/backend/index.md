What is a backend service?
--------------------------

[Section titled What is a backend service?](#what-is-a-backend-service)

A backend service is a cloud-based system that helps you build and manage your backend infrastructure. It provides a set of tools and services for managing databases, user authentication, and other server-side functionality. This enables you to focus on building your applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.

Why would I use a backend service?
----------------------------------

[Section titled Why would I use a backend service?](#why-would-i-use-a-backend-service)
