Unsupported image format
========================

> **UnsupportedImageFormat**: Received unsupported format `FORMAT` from `IMAGE_PATH`. Currently only SUPPORTED\_FORMATS.JOIN(’, ’) are supported by our image services.

What went wrong?
----------------

[Section titled What went wrong?](#what-went-wrong)

The built-in image services do not currently support optimizing all image formats.

For unsupported formats such as GIFs, you may be able to use an `img` tag directly:

    ---import rocket from '../assets/images/rocket.gif';---
    <img src={rocket.src} width={rocket.width} height={rocket.height} alt="A rocketship in space." />
