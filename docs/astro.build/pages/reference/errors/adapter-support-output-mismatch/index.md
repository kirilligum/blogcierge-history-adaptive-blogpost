Adapter does not support server output.
=======================================

> **AdapterSupportOutputMismatch**: The `ADAPTER_NAME` adapter is configured to output a static website, but the project contains server-rendered pages. Please install and configure the appropriate server adapter for your final deployment.

What went wrong?
----------------

[Section titled What went wrong?](#what-went-wrong)

The currently configured adapter does not support server-side rendering, which is required for the current project setup.

Depending on your adapter, there may be a different entrypoint to use for server-side rendering. For example, the `@astrojs/vercel` adapter has a `@astrojs/vercel/static` entrypoint for static rendering, and a `@astrojs/vercel/serverless` entrypoint for server-side rendering.
