Build your first Astro Blog
===========================

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn Astroâ€™s key features by building a fully-functioning blog, from zero to full launch! ðŸš€

Along the way, youâ€™ll:

*   Set up your development environment
*   Create pages and blog posts for your website
*   Build with Astro components
*   Query and work with local files
*   Add interactivity to your site
*   Deploy your site to the web

Want a preview of what youâ€™re going to build? You can view the final project on [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo) or open a working version in an online coding environment such as [IDX](https://idx.google.com/import?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwithastro%2Fblog-tutorial-demo%2F) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/complete?file=src%2Fpages%2Findex.astro).

Note

If you would rather start exploring Astro with a pre-built Astro site, you can visit [https://astro.new](https://astro.new) and choose a starter template to open and edit in an online editor.
