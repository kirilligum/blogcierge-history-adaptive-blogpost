Check in: Unit 3 - Components
=============================

Now that you have `.astro` and `.md` files generating entire pages on your website, it’s time to make and reuse smaller bits of HTML with Astro components!

Looking ahead
-------------

[Section titled Looking ahead](#looking-ahead)

In this unit, you’ll learn how to create **Astro components** to reuse code for common elements across your website.

You’ll build:

*   A Navigation component that presents a menu of links to your pages
*   A Footer component to include at the bottom of each page
*   A Social Media component, used in the Footer, that links to profile pages
*   An interactive Hamburger component to toggle the Navigation on mobile

Along the way, you’ll use CSS and JavaScript to build a responsive design that reacts to screen sizes and user input.
