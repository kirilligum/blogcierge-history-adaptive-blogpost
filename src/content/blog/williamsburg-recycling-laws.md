Living in Williamsburg means vibrant culture, unique shops, and a strong sense of community. Part of being a good neighbor and a responsible New Yorker is keeping our streets clean and our environment healthy. And a huge part of that? Recycling!

Navigating the ins and outs of recycling in New York City, which fully applies to us here in Williamsburg, can sometimes feel a bit complex. But fear not! This guide will break down the essential recycling laws and tips to help you do your part effectively.

## Recycling: It's Not Just a Suggestion, It's the Law!

First things first: recycling is **mandatory** for all residents, schools, and businesses in New York City, including our beloved Williamsburg. The NYC Department of Sanitation (DSNY) sets the rules, and following them helps reduce landfill waste, conserve natural resources, and create a cleaner city for everyone.

## The Two Main Streams: Know Your Bins (or Bags!)

NYC's curbside recycling program is generally divided into two main categories:

### Metal, Glass, Plastic, and Cartons (MGPC):

**What to include:**

*   **Metal:** Empty aerosol cans (no plastic caps), metal food and beverage cans, aluminum foil and trays (clean), empty and dried paint cans (metal lids recycled separately), wire hangers.
*   **Glass:** Empty glass bottles and jars.
*   **Plastic:** Rigid plastics such as bottles, jugs, jars, tubs, and some food containers (rinse them out!). Look for the recycling symbol, but generally, if it's a rigid plastic container, it's a go.
*   **Cartons:** Milk cartons, juice boxes, soup and broth cartons, etc. (rinse them out!).

**How to set out:** Place these items together in a clear plastic bag or in a recycling bin (55 gallons or less) clearly labeled with a blue DSNY decal or "Recycling: Metal/Glass/Plastic". If using your own bin, ensure it has a secure lid.

### Mixed Paper and Cardboard:

**What to include:**

*   Newspapers, magazines, catalogs, phone books.
*   Mail, envelopes (window envelopes are okay).
*   Paper bags.
*   Smooth cardboard (like shoeboxes, cereal boxes â€“ remove plastic liners).
*   Corrugated cardboard boxes (flattened and tied with sturdy twine into bundles no more than 18 inches high).

**How to set out:** Place these items together in a clear plastic bag or in a recycling bin (55 gallons or less) clearly labeled with a green DSNY decal or "Recycling: Paper/Cardboard". Flattened cardboard can also be bundled and placed next to your bins or bags. **Do NOT use cardboard boxes as recycling bins themselves.**

### Important Set-Out Times & Rules:

*   **Bins (55 gallons or less with a secure lid):** Can be placed at the curb after 6:00 PM the night before your collection day.
*   **Clear Plastic Bags:** Can be placed at the curb after 8:00 PM the night before your collection day.
*   To ensure collection, all recycling must be set out by midnight.

You can find your specific collection schedule by visiting the DSNY website and entering your address.

## The New Frontier: Mandatory Composting is Here!

Big news for all NYC residents, including those in Williamsburg: separating food waste and yard waste for composting is now **mandatory citywide**. This includes food scraps, food-soiled paper, and plant trimmings.

**How to set out compost:** Use a DSNY brown bin or your own lidded bin (55 gallons or less) labeled for compost.

Fines for non-compliance with composting rules are set to begin starting **April 1, 2025**. So, it's crucial to get in the habit now!

## What NOT to Recycle in Your Curbside Bins:

*   **Plastic Bags:** These are a major contaminant at recycling facilities. Return clean and dry plastic bags to participating retail stores.
*   **Styrofoam:** Not accepted in curbside recycling.
*   **Electronics:** (e.g., computers, TVs, cell phones) These require special disposal. Visit the DSNY website for e-waste recycling options.
*   **Batteries:** Household alkaline batteries can go in the trash. Rechargeable batteries should be taken to retail drop-off locations or special waste drop-off sites.
*   **Light Bulbs:** Fluorescent bulbs require special disposal. Incandescent bulbs can go in the trash.
*   **Hardcover Books:** Donate them or check for special paper recycling events. Only softcover books go in mixed paper recycling.
*   **Soiled Items:** Heavily food-soiled paper or containers (beyond a quick rinse) should go in the trash or compost if applicable.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance:

DSNY can issue fines for not recycling correctly, for improper set-out of materials, or for not separating compostables. Fines can range from $25 to $400 or more, with penalties increasing for repeat offenses.

## Why This Matters for Williamsburg:

Our neighborhood's charm is in its streets, parks, and the collective effort of its residents. Proper recycling and waste disposal directly impact our quality of life, reducing litter, pests, and the environmental burden on our city.

## Stay Informed & Do Your Part!

*   **DSNY Website (nyc.gov/dsny):** The ultimate resource for all things sanitation and recycling in NYC. You can find detailed guides, collection schedules, and information on special waste disposal.
*   **Call 311:** For any specific questions or to report issues.

Let's all pitch in to keep Williamsburg clean, green, and a place we're proud to call home. Happy recycling!
