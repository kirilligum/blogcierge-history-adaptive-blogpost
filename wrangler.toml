# NOTE: How bindings are configured.
#
# For local development (`yarn preview`), bindings are defined below using `preview_id`
# and `preview_bucket_name`. The actual resource IDs for your local setup are
# substituted from the `.dev.vars` file at runtime. This file is generated
# automatically when you run `yarn setup:cloudflare`.
#
# For production, bindings MUST be configured in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard
# (Settings > Functions > Production bindings). The `id` and `bucket_name` fields
# below are just placeholders and are ignored during a Pages deployment.
#
# This approach keeps resource IDs out of version control.
